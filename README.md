HOW TO HELP NEWLY PRODUCED BUNNIES BREASTFEED.

- Newly born bunnies have their eyes closed for a period of two weeks after birth.

- As a result they need assistance during breastfeeding for two weeks,awaiting opening of the eyes.

- Hold the bunny and direct its mouth on the breast of its mother,automatically it starts suckling.

- when their eyes are open after two weeks period,keep them in the same cage with the mother,it will get used to the bunnies,and will start breast feeding on its own.

- Note that,at this stage food is constant in that particular cage,to avoid predation.
